    "This homework is for practicing Python’s *generators* and the design of *streaming* algorithms in general. We’re going to use the **citibike.csv** data set that we had played around with in the labs, and another Citibike's data set called **citibike_docking_events.csv**. Both of them are available CUNY Blackboard under *Data Sets* section. You are required to turn in this notebook with all the parts filled in place of <###>. Your notebook must be named BDM\\_HW1.ipynb."

The first ride of the day is interpreted as the ride with the earliest starting time of a day. For the sample data, which is a week worth of citibike records, your generator should only generate 7 items (one for each day).\n",

Please adjust this generator to output the first ride of the day for the entire stream as specified above. The output of the generator must be in the same format as csv.DictReader. You can think of this generator as a filter only passing certain records out."

    "Since every row has a 'starttime' and 'stoptime' column it becomes a tedious task to find the maxActiveUsers for any point in time. My approach for this problem is to simly create a list called 'times'. As we stream through every row I simply add the row's 'stoptime' to the list 'times'. As we move down through the data -- if at any point the row's 'starttime' is equal to any of the elements in the list 'times' then that tells me that I have reached the maximum of active users thus far. The 'times' is never larger than 250 elements and iteration through that manny elements is not a time consuming task. "
